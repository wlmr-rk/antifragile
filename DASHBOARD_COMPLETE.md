## üìä Data Sources

### Real-time Queries
```typescript
// Todos data
const todos = useQuery(api.todos.getTodos, { includeCompleted: true });
const dailySummary = useQuery(api.todos.getDailyTasksSummary, {});

// Habits data
const habitsSummary = useQuery(api.habits.getHabitsSummary, {});

// Fitness data
const runStats = useQuery(api.runs.getRunStats, {});
const workoutStats = useQuery(api.workouts.getWorkoutStats, {});

// Focus data
const matrixSummary = useQuery(api.eisenhower.getMatrixSummary, {});
```

All data updates in real-time via Convex WebSocket!

---

## üßÆ Calculations

### Productivity Score Algorithm
```typescript
score = (
  (dailyTasksPercentage * 0.25) +
  (habitsPercentage * 0.25) +
  (min(workoutsThisWeek/5, 1) * 0.25) +
  (min(runsThisWeek/3, 1) * 0.25)
) * 100
```

### Correlation Logic
- **Workout-Task Correlation:** When workouts ‚â•1 AND tasks ‚â•70%
- **Habit Consistency:** When habits ‚â•80%
- **Running Impact:** When runs ‚â•3/week
- **Focus Alert:** When daily tasks <50%
